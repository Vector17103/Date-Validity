# Date Validity Checker (Java)

This is a simple **Date Validity Program written in Java** that checks whether a given date is valid or not.  
The user enters a date in **six-digit format (DDMMYY)**, and the program validates it by checking:

- Correct day range for each month
- Leap year and non-leap year conditions
- Valid month values

If the date is valid, it prints the date in a readable format along with **“VALID DATE”**.  
Otherwise, it prints **“INVALID DATE”**.

## About This Project

This was **my first Java project after learning Java in high school**.  
I built this program to practice:

- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- String manipulation
- User input using `Scanner`
- Basic date logic and leap year calculation

This project represents my early learning phase in Java and my first step into writing logical programs independently.

## Concepts Used

- Java `Scanner` class for input
- String conversion and substring operations
- Leap year checking
- Nested `if-else` statements
- Basic validation logic

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure Java is installed on your system.
2. Compile the program:
